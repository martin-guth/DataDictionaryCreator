# Data Dictionary Creator

Data Dictionary Creator (DDC) is a simple Windows application which helps you document SQL Server databases. 
Power Features are:
* Edit multiple extended properties for columns in a grid view....forget all the clicking or scripting in SSMS

* Export your documentation to Office Formats
* Import your documentation from XML or TSQL in case you need to write it again to the database

Credits and big thanks go to Ken Blanchard, Jon Galloway, Ben Grisworld and Tyler Ganon. The software was originally published on CodePlex.
Also Kudos to Thorsten Kansy (https://github.com/dotnetconsultingEU)  for the upgrade from .NET Framework 1.0 to the most current 4.8.

The software is provided AS IS without any Warranty.
You could contact me with questions how to use the software...however I am not a .NET programmer myself and can't provide any bug fixes.

To use the software download and unzip DDC.zip and run DataDictionaryCreator.exe
No installation is required.
